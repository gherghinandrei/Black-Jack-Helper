# Basic functionality
  * [ ] First api call:

    * response (stand, hit, double, split)
  * [ ] Based on the game state, several calls could happened, for every new card dealt 
  * [ ] When player finish his hand, we press a button to declare that his hand is over, so we have to choose the burned cards => last api call
